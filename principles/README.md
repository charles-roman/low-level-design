# Design Principles

Design principles are general guidelines that help developers create software that is **robust, maintainable, and scalable**. They are not strict rules but best practices that guide decision-making in software architecture and implementation.

At the **low-level**, these principles focus on the structure and interaction of classes, functions, and modules â€” shaping the way individual components are written and how they collaborate.
