# Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a mechanism that allows one class (called a *subclass*, *derived class*, or *child class*) to acquire the properties and behaviors (i.e., attributes and methods) of another class (called a *superclass*, *base class*, or *parent class*).

- It enables a new class to **reuse**, **extend**, or **modify** the functionality defined in an existing class, promoting **code reuse** and a natural **hierarchical relationship** between classes
