# Abstraction
**Abstraction** is the principle of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object or system.

- It allows programmers to interact with objects through **simple, high-level interfaces**
- The internal workings (implementation) are **hidden (abstracted away)**, so the user doesn't need to understand the underlying details

## ðŸ‘‰ **Example:**

> A common example of **abstraction** is when creating an **abstract class**, which defines an interface including various **abstract methods**. These methods are then implemented uniquely in **subclasses** (also called *concrete classes*) that inherit from the abstract class. This interfaceâ€”this *abstraction*â€”allows programs or programmers to interact with subclass objects **without needing to worry about their specific implementations**.
