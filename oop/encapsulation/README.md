# Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the concept of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to occur through well-defined interfaces (typically methods).

- This protects an objectâ€™s integrity by preventing external code from directly modifying its internal state in unintended ways
- It also allows you to change implementation details without affecting the code that uses the object

## ðŸ‘‰ **Example:**

> A common example of **encapsulation** is restricting access to object properties, allowing them to be accessed or modified only through methods (**getters** and **setters**) defined in the interface.
